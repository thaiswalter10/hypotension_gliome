Intraoperative hypotension as a risk factor of ischemic lesions on early postoperative MRI: evidence from a retrospective series of 90 patients with glioma surgical resection

__Introduction__  
  
Brain and other nervous system tumours are amongst the five leading causes of death by cancer for people under 40 years old in the United States in 2016(1). With an incidence of 11 new cases per year and per 100 000 inhabitants, glioma tumours have the highest brain tumour incidence(2) with a five year specific mortality rate ranging from 18% to 85%  depending on the grade of the tumour (3).  
  
The awake surgery is a technique that allows intraoperative functional mapping of brain areas before their resection. Brain areas and/or network are transiently disrupted by applying an electrical current, resulting in a reversible dysfunction. This technique allows maximization of tumour resection while minimizing neurological deficits (4). This change of paradigm has allowed for a drastic reduction of postoperative major neurological acquired deficits while improving the extent of tumour resection. It thus succeeded in reducing both long-term mortality and postoperative neurological impairment (5). Today’s challenge is to go further in reducing postoperative morbidity by focusing on reducing not only speech and motor acquired deficits, but also postoperative cognitive deficits.  
  
One of the factor that could explain postoperative cognitive decline is the existence of mini-strokes seen around the walls of the surgical cavity on the early postoperative MRI. (6)(7). Little is known about the risk factors of both postoperative ischemic lesions and postoperative cognitive deficits. More specifically their association with intraoperative hypotension has never been studied. 
In the present retrospective monocentric study amongst French adults operated on for a glioma tumour, we sought to examine the association between intraoperative hypotension defined as a relative decrease of arterial blood pressure compared to baseline pressure and the presence of cerebral ischemic lesions on an early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

__Statistical analysis__  
  
The results are expressed as median and interquartile range, mean and standard deviation or count and percentage, as appropriate.  The linearity of the association between the duration of hypotension and primary and secondary outcomes were checked using restricted cubic splines. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using a chi-squared test if the numbers were greater than 5, or with the Fisher's exact test if not.   
  
The linearity of the association between the duration of hypotension and the primary outcome was checked using restricted cubic splines. Association between the exposure and the outcome was assessed using a logistic model. The model was adjusted for potential confounders, namely age older than 40, duration of the procedure exceeding 350 minutes, and sex. Analysis within the corresponding subgroups were considered. Any p-values smaller than 0.05 was considered to show statistically significant differences. All statistical analysis was performed using R software version 3.3.3 (The “R” Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
